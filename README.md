# Harry Potter Memory Gane

## About
In this game, a user can test their memory by seeing if they can click all 12 images, one at a time, without clicking on an image twice. 
<br>
As the user clicks, the correct clicks counter increases with each correct click. Meanwhile, the highest clicks counter keeps track of the users highest number of correct clicks. If a user guesses incorrectly, the losses counter increases by one and the correct click counter restarts. If a user correctly guesses all 12 images without repeating, the wins counter increases by one and the correct counter resets to zero.
